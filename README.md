WIP

RLArena is an app utilising the DL4J library which uses reinforcement learning concepts to train a bot to play a simple 2D 
arena game. RLArena is still a proof of concept and requires work to complete the DQN class in particular.

I'll be contributing to this project more as I learn more about reinforcement learning and Java.

Contributions are very welcome here.
